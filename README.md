Test Design Decisions Notes

Independent Tests: 
    All tests are isolated and can be executed individually which improves reliability.

Assertions and Error Handling: 
    All tests includes validation using Playwrightâ€™s built-in assertion library 'expect' to improve test 
    robustness and provide easier debugging.

Page Object Model (POM): 
    Tests are structured using POM for better readability and maintainability.

Comments for Clarity: 
    Key steps in the test scripts are clearly commented to improve readability and understanding.
